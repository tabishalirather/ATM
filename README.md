- You have installed the latest version of [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tabishalirather/ATMApp.git
```
2. Open the project in JetBrains Rider or any other .NET compatible IDE.

## Project Description

The ATMApp is a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It's designed to mimic the key functionalities of a real-world ATM. The application allows users to perform several operations such as:

- Checking account balance: Users can view their current account balance.
- Depositing money: Users can deposit money into their account.
- Withdrawing money: Users can withdraw money from their account.
- Exiting the system: Users can safely exit the system.

The application is built using the WPF framework, which allows for a highly customizable and interactive user interface. The application starts from `App.xaml.cs` which creates and displays the main window of the application. The main window is defined in `MainWindow.xaml`.

The `Main` method, which is the entry point of the application, is auto-generated and not explicitly defined in the source files. It is located in the `App.g.cs` and `App.g.i.cs` files, which are auto-generated by the .NET build process.

## Build and Run

To build and run the application, navigate to the project's directory and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```
